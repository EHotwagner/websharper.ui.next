> [Documentation](../README.md) ▸ [API Reference](API.md) ▸ [Animation](Animation.md) ▸ **NormalizedTime**

Normalized time typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, though can
temporarily take values outside of this range.  It is used heavily
in animation.  Implemented as a type alias:

```fsharp
namespace IntelliFactory.WebSharper.UI.Next

type NormalizedTime = double
```
